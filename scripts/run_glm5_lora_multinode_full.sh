#  run_glm5_lora_multinode_full.sh
#    PRESET wrapper around scripts/run_glm5_lora_multinode.sh that pins the
#    VALIDATED full-scale GLM-5.2 (744B, 78L) LoRA-RL e2e recipe on 8 nodes x
#    8 H200 = 64 GPU. This is the exact config used to bring the e2e up
#    (rollout -> train -> save) on 2026-06-24; every knob below is a default
#    you can still override from the environment.
#
#    It does NOT reimplement anything -- it just exports the validated knobs
#    and delegates to run_glm5_lora_multinode.sh {head|worker|launch}.
#
#  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  WHY THESE DEFAULTS (hard-won; see the per-knob notes):
#   * BACKEND=slime  -> the FUSED TileLang DSA backend. The unfused
#       (megatron-bridge) backend OOMs on GPU at seq>=~8192: its mcore DSA
#       indexer `_compute_index_scores` materialises a [s,b,h,t] fp32 score
#       tensor (O(seq^2), ~8 GiB at seq 8192) and CP>1 is rejected
#       ("Currently context parallelism is not supported by DSAttention") and
#       expandable_segments is incompatible with torch_memory_saver. The fused
#       lighting_indexer never materialises that tensor -> no GPU OOM.
#   * R3=on (default)  -> adds ONLY --use-rollout-routing-replay (rollout MoE top-8
#       replayed in training for on-policy parity; cheap sglang routed-experts capturer
#       ~0.5 GB/rank). It does NOT add --use-rollout-indexer-replay: that DSA indexer
#       top-k replay is a DEBUG aid (the slime kernel recomputes the top-k, so training
#       does not need it) and it was the killer -- it makes sglang allocate an
#       IndexerTopkCapturer HOST pinned buffer (max_total_num_tokens, num_layers, 2048)
#       int32 ~= 78-128 GB/rank * 8 ranks/node -> blows the ~1.78 TB pod cgroup ->
#       RolloutManager host-OOM (SIGTERM) -> cluster-wide sglang crash. With indexer
#       replay gone, --sglang-max-total-tokens can stay at the sglang default for full
#       rollout throughput. (R3=off drops routing replay too -> fully off-policy; only
#       for quick mechanics bring-up.)
#   * dapo SEQ=8192 / RESP_LEN=4096 -> window > response so prompt+response is hard-capped at 8192
#       and the colocate window is bounded. RESP_LEN 4096 is the reward/throughput sweet spot
#       (rollout-only raw_reward sweep: 1024=0.0, 2048=0.125, 4096=0.25, 8192=0.3125; >4096 = 2x time).
#   * EP32 / PP1 / CP1  -> the only validated full-model layout. PP>1 trips the
#       GLM-5.2 cross-layer-DSA build assert (a PP stage must START on a compute
#       layer, freq=4 index-share group); CP>1 is unsupported by DSAttention.
#   * --lora-base-cpu-backup is OFF (default) -- its sglang host mirror
#       (~372 GB/node) is extra host pressure and not needed.
#
#  OPS GOTCHAS learned during bring-up (NOT encoded here -- do them by hand):
#   * If a worker pod OOM-restarts, its CONTAINER-LOCAL pip editable installs
#     revert to the image (sglang -> /sgl-workspace/sglang, miles -> /root/miles)
#     even though /personal/* persists on the PVC. Symptom: actor import fails
#     with "cannot import name 'ParallelismContext' from sglang...". FIX: re-run
#       pip install -e /personal/sglang/python -e /personal/miles \
#                      -e /personal/Megatron-Bridge --no-build-isolation --no-deps
#     on the affected ranks, THEN relaunch.
#   * If the Ray cluster has < 64 GPU (dead raylets from earlier crashes), the
#     64-GPU PACK placement group hangs forever at "Creating placement group".
#     Reform a CLEAN cluster (ray stop --force on all ranks, then head + workers)
#     before launching. Verify `ray status` shows /64.0 GPU and 8 ALIVE nodes.
#  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  USAGE (same head/worker/launch flow as run_glm5_lora_multinode.sh):
#    # HEAD:
#    HEAD_IP=<ip> bash scripts/run_glm5_lora_multinode_full.sh head
#    # each of the other 7 workers:
#    HEAD_IP=<ip> bash scripts/run_glm5_lora_multinode_full.sh worker
#    # HEAD, once `ray status` shows 8 nodes / 64 GPU:
#    export WANDB_API_KEY=...                 # NEVER hardcode the key
#    HEAD_IP=<ip> bash scripts/run_glm5_lora_multinode_full.sh launch
#
#    # longer responses / cap the window for colocate memory:
#    RESP_LEN=8192 SEQ=10240 R3=on \
#      HEAD_IP=<ip> bash scripts/run_glm5_lora_multinode_full.sh launch
