"""Slot pool: trainer-slot tenancy for multi-LoRA adapters.

A slot is a rented container, not an adapter identity: it holds
the Megatron adapter weights, the per-slot optimizer state, and the per-slot
scheduler while a tenant is bound. Registration-time binding (``bind_immediately``)
serves today's fixed-slot lifetime and Option 1's bootstrap; bind transactions
(``plan_bind`` / ``commit_bind`` / ``abort_bind``) serve bind-at-selection under
slot oversubscription.

All mutations must run on the controller actor's driver-sequenced path — never
from HTTP handlers.
