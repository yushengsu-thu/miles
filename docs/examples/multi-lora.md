- `serve_qwen3_30b_a3b_tinker.py`: prepare Qwen3-30B-A3B and launch the gateway.
- Other base models use the same launcher with the model definition from `scripts/models/`, e.g. Qwen3.5-35B-A3B: `serve --model-type qwen3.5-35B-A3B_lora --hf-checkpoint <dir>/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B --extra-args "--tinker-base-model Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B"`. The gateway derives the LoRA layout from the HF config (Qwen3.5/3.6: attention, GDN in/out projections, routed and shared experts, output layer, off the MTP block) and, for GatedDeltaNet models, switches the trainer to one unpacked sequence per micro-batch (`--qkv-format bshd --micro-batch-size 1`, since megatron-core rejects packed sequences there).
- `run_multi_tenant_example.py`: check marker memorization for one client or adapter isolation across concurrent tenants.

## Layout

One 8-GPU node, disaggregated (multi-LoRA forbids `--colocate`):

- 4 training GPUs: TP2 for the dense layers, EP4 for the 128 routed experts.
- 4 sampling GPUs: two SGLang engines of 2 GPUs each, serving adapter versions by name.
- 4 adapter slots (`--multi-lora-n-adapters`), rank up to 32, covering attention
  (`linear_qkv`, `linear_proj`), the per-expert MoE projections (`linear_fc1`, `linear_fc2`),
  and the output layer (`output_layer`) so the cookbook's default `train_unembed=True` is servable.

The gateway currently resolves Tinker training groups for `qwen3` and `qwen3_moe`.
`--tinker-train-attn`, `--tinker-train-mlp`, and `--tinker-train-unembed` default to enabled;
use `--no-tinker-train-attn`, `--no-tinker-train-mlp`, or `--no-tinker-train-unembed` to disable a group.
Every client's corresponding SDK flags must match the server layout. Tinker startup rejects
`--target-modules` and `--exclude-modules`; native Miles training still accepts them.

## Run

The gateway implements the `tinker==0.26.2` wire schema (newer SDKs renamed protobuf fields); install that exact version on the serving node and the client:

```bash
pip install "tinker==0.26.2"
```

Start the gateway:

```bash
python examples/multi_lora/serve_qwen3_30b_a3b_tinker.py prepare   # once per node
python examples/multi_lora/serve_qwen3_30b_a3b_tinker.py serve     # Tinker API on :10613
```

Checkpoints default to `<output_dir>/checkpoints/<run_id>`; use `--save-dir` to choose another root.

Install `tinker` on the client, then run the marker checks:

```bash
# one client: train, save for sampler, sample back the marker
python examples/multi_lora/run_multi_tenant_example.py --base-model /root/models/Qwen3-30B-A3B --mode single

# four tenants training concurrently on the same prompt with different markers;
# passing means the adapters stayed isolated end to end
python examples/multi_lora/run_multi_tenant_example.py --base-model /root/models/Qwen3-30B-A3B --mode multi --clients 4
```

## Supported inputs

Training accepts text with 1-D loss inputs. 2-D soft targets, including SDFT,
are not supported. Sampling requires a `/sampler_weights/` path returned by
`save_weights_for_sampler()`; `/weights/` training checkpoints cannot be sampled directly.

## Failure handling

A terminal failure of `forward_backward`, `optim_step`, or `load_state` ends
training for that model, including commands already queued behind it.
This includes content validation failures with a valid model and sequence.
Create a new model and restore a saved checkpoint to continue; completed
futures and published checkpoints keep their results.

Known request-local failures of `forward` or sampling leave model training
available. Checkpoint load/save execution failures, including filesystem errors,
invalidate the shared trainer cell and stop the server.
Saving sampler weights commits an immutable directory;
it does not call the inference engines. Sampling loads that snapshot from disk
on demand, including after cache eviction. An engine load failure fails the
sampling request; it leaves the snapshot and training state intact. Unknown
trainer execution failures invalidate the shared trainer cell and stop the server.

This gateway provides failure isolation, not automatic training recovery.
Checkpoints persist; futures, deduplication, and unsaved accumulation do not
survive a server restart.

## Sampler snapshots

Training and inference must use the same base checkpoint. Tinker engines load
that frozen base at startup and serve without trainer weight updates; dummy
loading and `update_weights: true` are rejected. Ordinary full-model and
single-LoRA training continue to use the existing weight updater.

`--tinker-checkpoint-root` must be on storage shared by the trainers, gateway,
and every inference engine. A sampler save exports the current adapter weights,
then publishes its tensors, adapter config, and `META.json` together through an
atomic symlink replacement. Existing sampler versions cannot be overwritten. Saving between
`forward_backward` and `optim_step` neither applies nor discards pending gradients.

Training checkpoint names also point to immutable version directories. Overwriting
atomically switches the link; older versions remain on disk for active readers.
Legacy directory checkpoints can still be loaded; save under a new name instead
of overwriting them.
